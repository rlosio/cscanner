# S3 Rules

This section details the rules relevant to AWS S3 and compatible object storages.

## Do not permit an S3 bucket to be public

This rule checks S3 bucket ACLs so that they are not public. The configuration goes like this:

```yaml
- type: S3_PUBLIC_READ_PROHIBITED
  include:
    - some.*regexp
  exclude:
    - some.*regexp  
```


### include

This option accepts a regular expression to match against the bucket name. If include is specified, only
the security groups with the specified name will be considered.

Note that each cloud provider implements buckets differently. The [AWS provider](../providers/aws.md), for example,
will return an ARN.

### exclude

This option lets you exclude certain buckets from checking, similar to include above. The
exclude rule takes precedence over include.

### scanContents

This is a true/false flag indicating if the contents of the buckets should be scanned for ACL violations.
If true all files in the bucket will be checked, which may take a very long time. If false only the bucket ACL will
be evaluated.
