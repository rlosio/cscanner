The yaml files have two sections: \nconnections\n and \nrules\n.\n\n\nIn \nconnections\n you configure your various cloud accounts, such as this:\n\n\nexoscale-test:\n  type: exoscale\n  key: \"\"\n  secret: \"\"\n\n\n\n\nThe respective options for each cloud provider are documented in their documentation. The connection name can then \nreferenced with the rules.\n\n\nThe next section is the \nrules\n section, which you can specify your rules in:\n\n\n- type: FIREWALL_PUBLIC_SERVICE_PROHIBITED\n  protocol: tcp\n  ports:\n    - 22\n\n\n\n\nEach rule has two universal parameters: \ntype\n to specify the rule type and \nconnections\n which you can use to\nlimit the rule to only certian connections. The default is to use all connections.\n\n\nIf a certain cloud provider doesn't support a specific functionality, that cloud provider will be simply skipped for\nthe specified rule.\n\n\nSupported cloud providers\n\n\nCurrently the following cloud providers are supported:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Web Services\n\n\nExoscale\n\n\n\n\nSupported rules\n\n\nCurrently the following rule sets are supported:\n\n\n\n\nFirewall\n\n\nS3\n\n\n\n\nCompiling\n\n\nIf you want to compile the utility from source, you will need \nMaven\n. Using Maven and at least\na JDK compatible with Java 8 you should be able to simply run \nmvn package\n to compile the source code and then find\nthe compiled binaries in \ncli/target\n.\n\n\nRunning\n\n\nTo run the cscanner, simply point it to your config file:\n\n\njava -jar cli-master-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar your-config-file.yaml",
